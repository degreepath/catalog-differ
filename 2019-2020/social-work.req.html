  <span class="body">
   The program actively seeks and encourages students from diverse backgrounds to consider a social work major and provides one-to-one advising.

 </p>
 <p class="body">
  First- and second-year students interested in social work are encouraged to meet with a faculty member and consult the

   department website
  </a>
  . The major application, admission requirements, requirements to remain in good standing in the program, processes for petitioning reinstatement, and grievance procedures for redress of any adverse decision are also there. The program does not discriminate against any student on the basis of age, class, color, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender identity and expression, geographic location, immigration status, physical or mental ability, political ideology, race, religion/spirituality, sex, or sexual orientation. Students are formally notified in writing of admission to the major by January of the junior year.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="body">
   Students who transfer to St. Olaf at or before the beginning of the junior (third) year may be considered for admission to the major, provided they have completed equivalent prerequisite courses in sociology, psychology, and human biology. Field practicum and practice courses must be completed while enrolled at St. Olaf. No credit or waiver is given for previous internship, work, or life experience.
