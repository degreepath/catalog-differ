  <h3>
   The Management Studies Capstone
  </h3>
  <p>
   The capstone project introduces students to the career planning process, helping them to identify career options and assess opportunities. This project includes career exploration activities, a description of future goals, and an academic and experiential action plan, as well as projects, papers, and other work that demonstrate specific skill development. The students will enter their materials using Moodle and developing a LinkedIn site. By interconnecting important facets of their education and experiential learning, students can demonstrate the relationships between their varied learning experiences.
