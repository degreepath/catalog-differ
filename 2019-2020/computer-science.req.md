A student arranges for a computer science major by individual contract with
the computer science faculty. This provides some latitude for choice according
to individual interests and background and allows the computer science faculty
to update the curriculum easily as the field of computer science evolves. Most
contracts adhere to the guidelines below, which derive from prominent national
recommendations for undergraduate computer science majors.

These guidelines represent four levels:

  * choice of introductory courses (  CSCI 121  or  CSCI 125  ) and three “second courses” (  CSCI 241  ,  CSCI 251  , and a proof-writing course) that may be taken in any order (note that the foundation courses offer non-majors a variety of one- to four-course samples of computer science); 

  * core courses in standard computer science topics, including algorithms and data structures, ethics of computing, computer languages, and computer systems; 

  * a deeper exposure to selected aspects of the discipline of computer science through electives; and 

  * a senior-level capstone integrative experience (  CSCI 390  ).
