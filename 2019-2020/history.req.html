  Public History Emphasis
 </h2>
 <p>
  Public History investigates the ways history is presented to, and consumed by, the general public.  Students acquire hands-on experience to prepare them for work in museums, cultural tourism, community history, historic preservation, cultural resource management, libraries, archives, new media, and many other professional fields.  In this program, students acquire technical skills and explore how audiences understand the past while developing research and interpretive skills to enrich the public's understanding of history.
 </p>
 <p>
  Requirements: 6 courses (5 credits) total, in conjunction with history major requirements.  All courses referenced below count toward both the major and the area of emphasis):
