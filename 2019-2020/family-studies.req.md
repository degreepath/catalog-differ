At least one elective must be outside the Department of Social Work and Family
Studies. These courses allow students to tailor their further knowledge about
families to fit a specific application area or to integrate with their chosen
majors. Elective courses not on this list may be counted with prior approval
of the program director.  
  
##  Experiential component

This requirement is usually an academic, credit-bearing experience completed
during the senior year (including the previous summer.) It is designed to
ensure that concentrators participate in an experience that applies basic
family knowledge (theories, frameworks, concepts) to real families in a
setting beyond the classroom. It must be approved by a faculty member in the
Department of Social Work and Family Studies **prior** to enrollment and
entered into the Department GoogleDoc. The experience and concomitant learning
is presented as a graded assignment for a public audience in the senior
seminar  FAMST 391  . Through the experience, students demonstrate attainment
of intended learning outcomes for family studies.

**Guidelines for the experiential component:**

Includes a minimum of 40 hours devoted to direct experience with families
(more than one family);

  1. Can be domestic or international; 
  2. Can be taken either graded or Pass/No Pass (P/N); 
  3. Can be submitted for distinction in a major, if it meets that department's guidelines for distinction; and 
  4. Must be approved by a faculty member in the Department of Social Work and Family Studies prior to enrollment. 

The experience _may_ be:

  * A project in a senior year course, or work with families in a social work practicum or nursing clinical; or 
  * An independent research project with family interaction (  FAMST 394  ); or 
  * An internship with a family serving agency (quarter-, half-, or full-credit  FAMST 294  ); or 
  * A summer experience prior to senior year that involves direct experience with families.
