  Students arrange a major in mathematics by developing an Individualized Mathematics Proposal (IMaP). An IMaP outlines a complete, coherent program of study consistent with the goals of the individual student. The courses included in a student’s IMaP are determined after consultation with an MSCS faculty member and approved by the department chair.

  A path through the major as described by a student's IMaP normally includes:

  An IMaP may include up to two related courses from statistics or computer science; a current listing of such courses is available on the
  <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/math/" target="_blank">
   mathematics web page
  </a>
  . A student may also find a course outside of MSCS that contributes significantly to a mathematical path of study and may petition to have the course included in his or her IMaP.

 <p>
  The
