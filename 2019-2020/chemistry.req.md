##  Requirements for a license to teach chemistry in grades 9-12 in Minnesota

A chemistry major who wishes to teach chemistry in grades 9-12 in Minnesota
must hold a valid [ Minnesota teaching license ](/academic-
programs/education/#requirementstext) in chemistry. In addition to the
chemistry major, additional science courses and the [ professional education
sequence ](/academic-programs/education/#text) are required. A license to
teach grades 5-8 in science is also available with additional course
requirements. Interested students should consult with a faculty advisor in the
Education Department for details of requirements and available options.
