A major in philosophy may be attained by completing the requirements for
either a regular major or a contract major. Most philosophy courses
simultaneously count toward the major and toward one or more general education
requirements. Because the philosophy major can be tailored to the needs and
goals of individual students, all philosophy majors are encouraged to work
closely with an advisor in the philosophy department.

**Policy Concerning PHIL 398 Independent Research (IR)** (Adopted 2/12/08)

In special circumstances, an IR course may be substituted for a level III
seminar. The circumstances are as follows:

  1. the IR must have a special relevance to the student's program of study in the major or contract major, serving as a capstone experience; 
  2. by November 1 of the senior year, the student must present a petition to the chair of the philosophy department before registering for spring courses. The petition should include a rationale explaining the special relevance of the project to his or her major. The chair has full authority to grant or decline the petition; 
  3. no more than one IR course, which must be taken graded, can be used to fulfill the requirement; the other level III course(s) must be seminar courses.

Students who complete the Great Conversation receive credit for one elective
philosophy course toward the major.  
  
These specifications seek to first assure a majorâ€™s grasp of the history and
methods of philosophy and then to provide practice in advanced philosophical
inquiry.

##  Contract Major

A contract major involves a contract drawn up between the student and the
Department of Philosophy. The contract combines the following:

Course List  Code  |  Title  |  Credits
