##  Requirements for a double major in Studio Art and Art History

Students who fulfill all core requirements for both studio art and art history
major may choose to count up to 17 full credits in the Department of Art and
Art History toward graduation when graduating with the normal 35 credits.
(Therefore, 18, rather than the usual 21, courses would be required outside of
art/art history.)
