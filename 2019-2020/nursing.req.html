   Admission and Progression
  </h2>
  <p>
   Students are encouraged to express an interest in the nursing major upon application for admission to St. Olaf College. Enrollment in the program is limited and admission is competitive; therefore, early consultation with the department chair is recommended. Interested students are assigned nursing faculty as academic advisors.

   Information for Students Not Applying or Not Selected for Direct Admission to the Nursing Program
  </h2>
  <p>
   Students who did not apply or were not selected for first-year direct admission may apply for admission to the nursing major during the fall of the sophomore year.  Application information is

   Information for All Students Applying to the Nursing Program
  </h2>
  <p>
   The nursing major begins in the spring semester of the sophomore year.  Conditional acceptance into the nursing major will become final if students meet the following criteria at the end of the sophomore year:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.85.
   </li>
   <li>
    Prerequisites must be taken for a letter grade, cumulative grade point average 2.70.
   </li>
   <li>
    Only one prerequisite course may be below C- and this course (or an alternate course approved by the Nursing Department chair) may be repeated once.
   </li>
   <li>
    A minimum grade of C- must be achieved in the repeated or substituted course.
   </li>
   <li>
    If a grade of C- is not achieved in the repeated or substituted course, the student may not continue in the major.
   </li>
   <li>
    If two or more prerequisite courses are below C-, the student may not continue in the major.
   </li>
   <li>
    Four prerequisite courses must be completed by the end of the fall semester of the sophomore year.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Students not accepted may choose to be placed on a waiting list and will be notified of their rank on that list. If openings occur, admission will be offered to waiting list students by rank, highest rank first. Students not accepted may appeal the admission decision to the Dean of the College.  The Academic Dean will ask for a written statement from both the student and the department prior to rendering a decision. The Dean's decision will be final.
  </p>
  <p>
   Students on the waiting list may reapply for admission to the nursing program the following year. They will be considered in the next pool of applicants but will not be guaranteed admission because they apply a second time.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the college health requirements, nursing students must also provide documentation of: physical examination, immunization to Hepatitis B, measles, mumps, varicella, rubella, influenza, and negative two-step Tuberculosis Skin Test (TST)/Mantoux
   <u>
    or
   </u>
   negative Blood Assay for Mycobacterium (BAMT)/TB serum test
   <u>
    or
   </u>
   negative chest x-ray (only with a positive TST) after June 1 of both the junior and senior years in the major.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuous certification in CPR must be maintained throughout the major. Students should complete a CPR course prior to beginning nursing courses that provides certification for the final two-year period they are enrolled in the major (typically junior and senior years). Students should select either the Basic Life Support for Health Providers course offered by the American Heart Association or the CPR/AED for Professional Rescuers and Healthcare Providers course offered by the American Red Cross.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to be qualified to provide direct patient services, students must undergo an annual criminal background study conducted by the Minnesota Department of Human Services (MDHS). If a student is disqualified by the MDHS, he or she will be unable to provide direct patient care and he or she will be dismissed from the nursing program.
  </p>
  <p>
   Students beginning the nursing program must also be a certified nursing assistant (CNA). Students will need to provide documentation of Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) Nursing Assistant registration after successful completion of a Certified Nursing Assistant/Nursing Assistant Registered program prior to beginning NURS 211. Students must meet all college requirements for graduation, as well as complete eight prerequisite courses.
