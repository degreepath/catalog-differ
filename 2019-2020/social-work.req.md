##  Requirements for the Major

###  Admission to and Retention in the Social Work Program

The program actively seeks and encourages students from diverse backgrounds to
consider a social work major and provides one-to-one advising.

First- and second-year students interested in social work are encouraged to
meet with a faculty member and consult the [ department website
](http://wp.stolaf.edu/socialwork/) . The major application, admission
requirements, requirements to remain in good standing in the program,
processes for petitioning reinstatement, and grievance procedures for redress
of any adverse decision are also there. The program does not discriminate
against any student on the basis of age, class, color, culture, ethnicity,
gender, gender identity and expression, geographic location, immigration
status, physical or mental ability, political ideology, race,
religion/spirituality, sex, or sexual orientation. Students are formally
notified in writing of admission to the major by January of the junior year.

Students who transfer to St. Olaf at or before the beginning of the junior
(third) year may be considered for admission to the major, provided they have
completed equivalent prerequisite courses in sociology, psychology, and human
biology. Field practicum and practice courses must be completed while enrolled
at St. Olaf. No credit or waiver is given for previous internship, work, or
life experience.

###  Requirements for the Social Work Major

Those interested in the major should contact a department faculty member in
their first year or as early as possible. Students in good standing at the
college who have satisfactorily completed prerequisite courses and SWRK 221
are eligible to apply for admission to the major. Students are granted major
status only after satisfactory completion of SWRK 221, SWRK 246, SWRK 254, and
a program application. Students should achieve a grade of C or better in all
prerequisite and required courses to progress in the major. Details are
specified in the program manual available from faculty or the department
