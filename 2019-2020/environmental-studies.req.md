####  Areas of Emphasis in the Environmental Studies Major

#####  Natural Science

The natural science area of emphasis seeks to give students a broad exposure to the range of problems encountered by scientists working in environmental fields and the investigative tools they use, while providing a solid foundation for further study in one of the contributing disciplines. Students planning careers in environmental science are strongly urged to consider an additional major in biology or chemistry. Nine courses are required in addition to the introductory, integration/application, and capstone courses specified above:

##  Environmental Studies Concentration

###  Requirements for the Concentration

The environmental studies concentration balances an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to the environment with the disciplinary strengths of a traditional major represented by the areas of study: natural science, social science, arts and humanities. Students may utilize environmental studies-related upper-level courses within their own discipline to complete requirements of the concentration if the courses have a significant component that addresses environmental concerns. Unless permission is granted by the chair, a course may not count for more than one requirement in the concentration. Successful completion of at least 6 courses with a grade of C or better is required.
