Students are encouraged to consult with their advisor and the program director
about the appropriate physics and mathematical sequences for their interests
as well as appropriate complementary courses.

##  Experiential Learning Component

Participation in an experimentally based research experience or employment
that takes biomolecular sciences beyond the traditional classroom is required
of each concentrator. This can occur either on- or off-campus. This activity
must be approved by the Biomolecular Science Director and presented to the
biomolecular science community.
