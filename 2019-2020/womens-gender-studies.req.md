##  Requirements for the Concentration

Many students enhance their work in a major through an interdisciplinary focus
on women and gender. A concentration in women’s and gender studies consists
of:

Course List  Code  |  Title  |  Credits  
---|---|---  
WMGST 121  |  Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies  |  1.00  
Four additional courses, three of which must be at level II or III, and they
must be drawn from at least three departments  |  4.00  
Total Credits  |  5  
  
In consultation with the instructor and the program director, concentrators
may count one course not designated as an approved women’s and gender studies
course. Students who apply partial-credit courses toward the concentration
must still complete the minimum number of required credits. No more than one
course taken elsewhere may be counted toward the concentration.
