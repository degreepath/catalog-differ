   A major in philosophy may be attained by completing the requirements for either a regular major or a contract major. Most philosophy courses simultaneously count toward the major and toward one or more general education requirements. Because the philosophy major can be tailored to the needs and goals of individual students, all philosophy majors are encouraged to work closely with an advisor in the philosophy department.

      In special circumstances, an IR course may be substituted for a level III seminar. The circumstances are as follows:
     </p>

      <li>
       the IR must have a special relevance to the student's program of study in the major or contract major, serving as a capstone experience;

       by November 1 of the senior year, the student must present a petition to the chair of the philosophy department before registering for spring courses. The petition should include a rationale explaining the special relevance of the project to his or her major. The chair has full authority to grant or decline the petition;
      </li>
      <li>
       no more than one IR course, which must be taken graded, can be used to fulfill the requirement; the other level III course(s) must be seminar courses.

   These specifications seek to first assure a major’s grasp of the history and methods of philosophy and then to provide practice in advanced philosophical inquiry.
