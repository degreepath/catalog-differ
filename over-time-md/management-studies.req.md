###  Experiential Learning

This requirement is satisfied by completing two approved experiences in which
the student applies management or financial principles to real world problems.
One of the activities must be an academic internship or an approved work
experience. The other activity can be a volunteer, leadership,
entrepreneurial, or related work experience. The [ Piper Center for Vocation
and Career ](http://wp.stolaf.edu/pipercenter/) and other organizations help
students with this requirement.

###  The Electronic Integrative Folder

The electronic integrative folder introduces students to the career planning
process, helping them to identify career options and access opportunities. The
folder includes the results of self-assessment and career exploration
activities, a description of future goals, and an academic and experiential
action plan, as well as projects, papers, and other work that demonstrate
specific skill development. The integrative folder is presented using Moodle
and a website. By interconnecting important pieces in a digital folder,
students can demonstrate the interrelatedness of their varied learning
experiences.
