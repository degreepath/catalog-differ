Available only to students through the class of 2016.

The historical perspectives concentration has no courses of its own. Instead,
it is a cluster of five courses that constitute a coherent focus on an epoch,
event, region, or theme. At least two, but no more than three, of the five
must be history courses. At least one course must be from the studentâ€™s major.
At least one course must be at level III.

To propose a concentration in historical perspectives, students must:

  1. Prepare a rationale that explains the internal coherence of the proposed concentration, including how each course contributes to the integrative learning experience. 
  2. Obtain approval of their selection of five courses from a faculty committee of three, one of whom must be a member of the History Department, who chairs the committee. 

Proposals should be made in a timely fashion and before all of the course work
has been completed. Students may initiate the approval process by contacting
any member of the History Department.
