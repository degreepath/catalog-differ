  Prospective physics majors should enroll in PHYS 130 Analytical Physics I in the fall semester of their first year, along with calculus or other math course recommended by placement in Mathematics. It is possible to complete the physics major with a sophomore year start in PHYS 130; interested students should consult with the department chair or other physics faculty member. Students with AP, IB, PSEO, or significant college-level experience in physics may seek advanced placement - to start in a course beyond PHYS 130 - by consulting with the department chair.

  Recommendations for Graduate Study
 </h2>
 <p>
  Students planning on graduate work in physics, engineering, materials science or related areas should choose appropriate electives in the major and consider additional coursework in mathematics, computer science, or other sciences, depending on the field of interest. Summer research experience is strongly recommended, especially for students entering Ph.D. programs. Students pursuing masters degrees in engineering are encouraged to complete internships in their areas of interest.
 </p>

  Specific recommendations for Physics programs: To prepare for graduate study in physics, students are advised to take Quantum Mechanics (
  <a href="/archive/2016-2017/search/?P=PHYS%20376" title="PHYS 376">
   PHYS 376

  )
 and Statistical Physics (
