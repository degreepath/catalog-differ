  <h3>
   Foundation Course
  </h3>
  <p>
   The biology major begins with BIO 150. This course explores the evolutionary and genetic foundations of life's biodiversity, and establishes the laboratory and scientific communication skills upon which subsequent courses build. AP or IB credit does not provide the equivalent of this foundation course; students with AP or IB credit instead receive one 100-level elective credit in the major. Students planning to major in biology should take this foundation course first; students who decide to switch to a biology major should take this foundation course at the time of deciding their major.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Core Categories
  </h3>
  <p>
   Students must take one course from each of the four core categories listed below. While the categories below are listed in order of biological level of organization, students may take their upper-level biology courses in any order providing that prerequisites are met. Please consult the course descriptions to see the prerequisites for each course.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>
     Genetics. Genetics examines relationships between genotype and phenotype in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms from classical and molecular perspectives. Through a course in this category, students will explore gene structure, inheritance, and expression. Through genetics, students discover the ways in which the field of genetics is interdisciplinary, research-based, and relevant to the world today. Course: BIO 233
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Cell Biology. Cells are the basic units of life, and understanding the structure and function of cells, and how they are studied, is central to understanding modern biology. Through a course in this category, students will obtain a comprehensive overview of cellular structure and function, for example cellular compartments, macromolecular structures, and life processes such as energy and material flux, cell division, and control mechanisms. Courses: either BIO 227 or CH/BI 227 (taken as part of the year-long CH/BI sequence)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    Comparative Organismal Biology. Courses in this category study life at the tissue, organ system, and individual levels of organization. Students will broaden their knowledge of a group of organisms (e.g., plants) or of a universal biological phenomenon (e.g., reproduction). Courses in this category approach the content through comparisons across multiple taxa. Courses: BIO 242, BIO 247, BIO 248, BIO 251, BIO 252, BIO 266, BIO 275, or participation in the

     Environmental Science in Australia
    </a>
    semester (but this program cannot count for both the Comparative Organismal and the Ecology core requirements)
   </li>
   <li>
    Ecology. Ecology is the study of the interactions between organisms and their environments. These interactions are studied at levels of biological organization from individuals to populations, communities, ecosystems, landscapes, and the entire biosphere. Through ecology, students can better understand interconnections in the natural world, and become more aware of their role in sustaining the biodiversity and ecosystem services that benefit all life on earth. Courses: BIO 261 or participation in the

   </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
   Level III Biology Course
  </h3>
  <p>
   Every biology major takes at least one level III course in the department. Our level III course offerings vary greatly in topic and in type of student work, yet they all share aspects such that each student has an opportunity to experience sophisticated, independent, iterative work in biology. Students in a directed research course will practice sophistication in experimental design and practice, independence in their investigation, and iterative troubleshooting. Students in a non-laboratory investigative course will practice sophistication in evaluating the primary literature, as well as independence in assembling and synthesizing ideas from that literature. Not all level III biology courses meet this requirement. Specifically, BIO 394 does not count toward the biology major, and any 300-level courses worth less than a full credit (BIO 375, and any 0.5 credit BIO 396 courses) cannot fulfill the Level III requirement. Sometimes Level III topics courses in other departments like Environmental Studies can count as the Level III biology course. Students should consult catalog descriptions for each level III course to learn about the topic, type of student work, and prerequisites.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Elective Courses
  </h3>
  <p>
   Students complete their biology major with two elective courses. Any full credit (1.00) biology course can count as an elective with the following exceptions:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Only one independent study (BIO 298) and one independent research (BIO 396 or BIO 398) can count toward the major.
   </li>
   <li>
    Internships (BIO 294 or BIO 394) do not count toward the major. BIO 294 and BIO 394 can only be taken P/N.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   In addition to courses designated as biology, the St. Olaf courses in the table below can count as biology electives:

  <h3>
   General Considerations for the Major
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     No more than two level I biology courses, including BIO 150, and AP or IB credit may count toward the major.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Of the six courses counting toward the major that must be graded C or above, at least four must be at level II or III.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Students wishing to count for the major a course taken abroad or at another institution must consult with the chair for approval before taking the course.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     While programs leading to graduate work are planned on an individual basis, many programs require students to have completed two or more quantitative courses (mathematics, statistics, or computer science), two courses in physics, and at least four courses in chemistry. Students intending to enter graduate or professional school are encouraged to consult with the biology faculty to plan a course of study appropriate for the postgraduate program.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Students pursuing a secondary school science education teaching license with a life science specialty should consider completing the biology major including BIO 123 or BIO 243 as one of their electives. Additional courses are required as specified by the Education Department. Interested students should consult faculty in the Education Department.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     All of the level II and III courses in biology have prerequisites. Please consult the course descriptions for this information.
