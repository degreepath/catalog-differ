  Requirements for the Latin American Studies Concentration
 </h2>
 <p>
  Students majoring in any discipline except Latin American studies can pursue a Latin American studies concentration, which enables them to enhance their understanding of Latin American countries and the interconnectedness of Latin America and the United States. It differs from the Latin American studies major in that it does not require course work in Spanish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The requirements for the completion of the Latin American studies concentration consist of a minimum of five approved courses.
