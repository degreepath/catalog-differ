 <p>
  Students studying off-campus through St. Olaf affiliated programs may count up to two off-campus courses as level II economic analysis courses towards the economics major requirements. These courses must be approved in advance by the chair of the Economics Department. To count towards the economics major, courses must (a) be in recognized fields in economics, (b) require at least Principles of Economics (ECON 121) (or its equivalent) as a prerequisite, and (c) be taught in an economics program or by faculty from an economics program. Students may not count both a St. Olaf economic analysis course and a course taken off campus towards the major if the courses are substantially the same.
 </p>
 <h2 headerid="8" name="requirementstext">
  Areas of Emphasis
 </h2>
 <p>
  The Economics Department offers four optional Areas of Emphasis that students may complete in addition to a major in economics. There are two economics areas:  (1) international economic analysis and policy and (2) public policy economics, and two management areas: (3) management and (4) finance. Students may be certified in no more than one economics and one management studies area of emphasis. Grades of C or better must be earned in all courses counted towards an area of emphasis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Contracts for each area of emphasis must be negotiated individually with the assigned area director before the end of the student’s junior year. Copies of contracts, which list required and elective courses for the areas, can be found on the
  <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/economics/forms/department-forms/" target="_blank">
   Economics Department web page
  </a>
  . Please contact the Economics Department for names of the current area directors.
 </p>
 <p>
  The economics areas of emphasis require three economic analysis courses beyond those required for the major including one level III economic analysis course. The management studies areas of emphasis require five courses including a level III management studies course. Courses counted towards an area of emphasis may not also be counted towards any requirements for the economics major.
