     At least one elective must be outside the Department of Social Work and Family Studies. These courses allow students to tailor their further knowledge about families to fit a specific application area or to integrate with their chosen majors. Elective courses not on this list may be counted with prior approval of the program director.

  Experiential component
 </h2>
 <p>
  This requirement is usually an academic, credit-bearing experience completed during the senior year (including the previous summer.) It is designed to ensure that concentrators participate in an experience that applies basic family knowledge (theories, frameworks, concepts) to real families in a setting beyond the classroom. It must be approved by a faculty member in the Department of Social Work and Family Studies prior to enrollment. The experience and concomitant learning is presented as a graded assignment for a public audience in the senior seminar FAMST 391. Through the experience, students demonstrate attainment of intended learning outcomes for family studies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Guidelines for the experiential component:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Includes a minimum of 40 hours devoted to direct experience with families (more than one);
  </li>
  <li>
   Can be domestic or international;
  </li>
  <li>
   Can be taken either graded or Pass/No Pass (P/N);
  </li>
  <li>
   Can be submitted for distinction in a major, if it meets that department's guidelines for distinction.
  </li>
  <li>
   Must be approved by a faculty member in the Department of Social Work and Family Studies prior to enrollment.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The experience may be:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A project in a senior year course, or work with families in a social work practicum or nursing clinical; or
  </li>
  <li>
   An independent research project with family interaction (FAMST 396); or
  </li>
  <li>
   An internship with a family serving agency (quarter-, half-, or full-credit; FAMST 294).
  </li>
  <li>
   A summer experience prior to senior year that involves direct experience with families.
  </li>
 </ul>
