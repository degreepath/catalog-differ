   With the approval of the program director, students assemble individualized programs of study involving a total of five courses. A concentration consists of a common introductory course, MEDIAÂ 160, plus three approved courses drawn from departments and programs across the curriculum, an academic internship in a media-related field, and a digital portfolio. The purpose of the digital portfolio is to compile a variety of materials related to a media studies education in an integrative and useful way. The portfolio has proven valuable for students applying for jobs and other professional opportunities.

   Requirements and plans for individual portfolios are discussed at a mandatory meeting for all junior and senior media studies concentrators, in the fall semester. Graduating concentrators submit their completed portfolios to the program director by April 15 of their senior year.
