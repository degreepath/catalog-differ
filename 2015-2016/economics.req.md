ECON 385  may count as a level III economic analysis course when taken to
fulfill the core course requirement.  
  
Students studying off-campus through St. Olaf affiliated programs may count up
to two off-campus courses as level II economic analysis courses towards the
economics major requirements. These courses must be approved in advance by the
chair of the Economics Department. To count towards the economics major,
courses must (a) be in recognized fields in economics, (b) require at least
Principles of Economics (ECON 121)  (or its equivalent) as a prerequisite, and
(c) be taught in an economics program or by faculty from an economics program.
Students may not count both a St. Olaf economic analysis course and a course
taken off campus towards the major if the courses are substantially the same.

##  Areas of Emphasis

The Economics Department offers four optional Areas of Emphasis that students
may complete in addition to a major in economics. There are two economics
areas: (1) international economic analysis and policy and (2) public policy
economics, and two management areas: (3) management and (4) finance. Students
may be certified in no more than one economics and one management studies area
of emphasis. Grades of C or better must be earned in all courses counted
towards an area of emphasis.

Contracts for each area of emphasis must be negotiated individually with the
assigned area director before the end of the studentâ€™s junior year. Copies of
contracts, which list required and elective courses for the areas, can be
found on the [ Economics Department web page
](http://wp.stolaf.edu/economics/forms/department-forms/) . Please contact the
Economics Department for names of the current area directors.

The economics areas of emphasis require three economic analysis courses beyond
those required for the major including one level III economic analysis course.
The management studies areas of emphasis require five courses including a
level III management studies course. Courses counted towards an area of
emphasis may not also be counted towards any requirements for the economics
major.
