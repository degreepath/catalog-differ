Admission and Progression

Students are encouraged to express an interest in the nursing major upon
application for admission to St. Olaf College. Enrollment in the program is
limited and admission is competitive; therefore, early consultation with the
department chair is recommended. Interested students are assigned nursing
faculty as academic advisors.

Students must apply for admission to the nursing major during the fall of the
sophomore year. Application information is available from the department chair
or website. Admission criteria include cumulative grade point average, grades
in prerequisite courses, essay, interview, and student status. Students
needing accommodations for the essay or interview and who have a documented
disability for which accommodations have been provided by the Academic Support
Center (ASC), need to contact Suzanne Kiehne, the AAA for the Department of
Nursing. Accommodations will only be provided after a letter from the ASC is
submitted to the Department of Nursing chair and with sufficient lead-time to
arrange accommodations prior to the scheduled essay or interview. Students
will be notified of their conditional acceptance into the major by a letter
from the nursing department chair during the January Interim of the sophomore
year. Nursing courses begin in the spring of the sophomore year.

Conditional acceptance into the nursing major will become final if students
meet the following criteria at the end of the sophomore year: a minimum
cumulative GPA of 2.85 and successful completion of all nursing prerequisite
courses with a GPA of 2.70. Prerequisites must be taken for a letter grade.
Only one prerequisite course may be below C-, and this course (or an alternate
course approved by the Nursing Department chair) may be repeated once. A
minimum grade of C- must be achieved in the repeated or substituted course. If
a grade of C- is not achieved in the repeated or substituted course, the
student may not continue in the major. If two or more prerequisite courses are
below C-, the student may not continue in the major.

Students not accepted may choose to be placed on a waiting list and will be
notified of their rank on that list. If openings occur, admission will be
offered to waiting list students by rank, highest rank first. Students on the
waiting list may also reapply for admission to the nursing program the
following year. They will be considered in the next pool of applicants but
will not be guaranteed admission because they apply a second time.

In the event that a student is denied admission to the program by the
department of nursing, and is subsequently unsuccessful in appealing the
decision within the department, the student may appeal to the Academic Dean,
who will ask for a written statement from both the student and the department
prior to rendering a decision. The Dean's decision will be final.

In addition to the college health requirements, nursing students must also
provide documentation of: physical examination, immunization to Hepatitis B,
measles, mumps, varicella, rubella, influenza, and negative two-step
Tuberculosis Skin Test (TST)/Mantoux _or_ negative Blood Assay for
Mycobacterium (BAMT)/TB serum test _or_ negative chest x-ray (only with a
positive TST) after June 1 of both the junior and senior years in the major.

Continuous certification in CPR must be maintained throughout the major.
Students should complete a CPR course prior to beginning nursing courses that
provides certification for the final two-year period they are enrolled in the
major (typically junior and senior years). Students should select either the
Basic Life Support for Health Providers course offered by the American Heart
Association or the CPR/AED for Professional Rescuers and Healthcare Providers
course offered by the American Red Cross.

In order to be qualified to provide direct patient services, students must
undergo an annual criminal background study conducted by the Minnesota
Department of Human Services (MDHS). If a student is disqualified by the MDHS,
he or she will be unable to provide direct patient care and he or she will be
dismissed from the nursing program.

Students beginning the nursing program must also be a certified nursing
assistant (CNA). Students will need to provide documentation of Minnesota
Department of Health (MDH) Nursing Assistant registration after successful
completion of a Certified Nursing Assistant/Nursing Assistant Registered
program prior to beginning the nursing program. Students must meet all college
requirements for graduation, as well as complete eight prerequisite courses.
