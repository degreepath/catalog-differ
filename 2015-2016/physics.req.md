Prospective physics majors should enroll in PHYS 130 Analytical Physics I in the fall semester of their first year, along with calculus or other math course recommended by placement in Mathematics. It is possible to complete the physics major with a sophomore year start in PHYS 130; interested students should consult with the department chair or other physics faculty member. Students with AP, IB, PSEO, or significant college-level experience in physics may seek advanced placement - to start in a course beyond PHYS 130 - by consulting with the department chair.

One physics elective numbered above 120 (this is waived for students obtaining teacher certification.)  |  1.00  
One additional physics elective numbered between 300 and 393  |  1.00  
Total Credits  |  8.75  
  
In some cases it is possible to use the PHYS 124-PHYS 125 sequence to transfer into the major; see the chair.

Remember to check the prerequisites for all courses. Mathematics prerequisites may include calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, partial differential equations, or multivariable calculus.

Students planning to apply for graduate study in physics are advised to take Quantum Mechanics (PHYS 376) and Statistical Physics (PHYS 379) and to consider additional physics electives or math courses such as complex analysis, abstract algebra, probability, statistics, numerical analysis, and real analysis.
