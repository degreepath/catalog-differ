    <strong>
     Admission and Progression
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Students are encouraged to express an interest in the nursing major upon application for admission to St. Olaf College. Enrollment in the program is limited and admission is competitive; therefore, early consultation with the department chair is recommended. Interested students are assigned nursing faculty as academic advisors.
   </p>
   <p class="introtext">
    Students must apply for admission to the nursing major during the fall of the sophomore year. Application information is available from the department chair or website. Admission criteria include cumulative grade point average, grades in prerequisite courses, essay, interview, and student status.
    <em>
     Students needing accommodations for the essay or interview and who have a documented disability for which accommodations have been provided by the Academic Support Center (ASC), need to contact Suzanne Kiehne, the AAA for the Department of Nursing.  Accommodations will only be provided after
    </em>
    <em>
     a
    </em>
    <em>
     letter from the ASC is submitted
    </em>
    <em>
     to the Department of Nursing chair and with sufficient lead-time to arrange accommodations prior to the scheduled
    </em>
    <em>
     essay or interview.
    </em>
    Students will be notified of their conditional acceptance into the major by a letter from the nursing department chair during the January Interim of the sophomore year. Nursing courses begin in the spring of the sophomore year.
   </p>
   <p>
    Conditional acceptance into the nursing major will become final if students meet the following criteria at the end of the sophomore year: a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.85 and successful completion of all nursing prerequisite courses with a GPA of 2.70. Prerequisites must be taken for a letter grade. Only one prerequisite course may be below C-, and this course (or an alternate course approved by the Nursing Department chair) may be repeated once. A minimum grade of C- must be achieved in the repeated or substituted course. If a grade of C- is not achieved in the repeated or substituted course, the student may not continue in the major. If two or more prerequisite courses are below C-, the student may not continue in the major.
   </p>
   <p>
    Students not accepted may choose to be placed on a waiting list and will be notified of their rank on that list. If openings occur, admission will be offered to waiting list students by rank, highest rank first. Students on the waiting list may also reapply for admission to the nursing program the following year. They will be considered in the next pool of applicants but will not be guaranteed admission because they apply a second time.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the event that a student is denied admission to the program by the department of nursing, and is subsequently unsuccessful in appealing the decision within the department, the student may appeal to the Academic Dean, who will ask for a written statement from both the student and the department prior to rendering a decision. The Dean's decision will be final.
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition to the college health requirements, nursing students must also provide documentation of: physical examination, immunization to Hepatitis B, measles, mumps, varicella, rubella, influenza, and negative two-step Tuberculosis Skin Test (TST)/Mantoux
    <u>
     or
    </u>
    negative Blood Assay for Mycobacterium (BAMT)/TB serum test
    <u>
     or
    </u>
    negative chest x-ray (only with a positive TST) after June 1 of both the junior and senior years in the major.
   </p>
   <p>
    Continuous certification in CPR must be maintained throughout the major. Students should complete a CPR course prior to beginning nursing courses that provides certification for the final two-year period they are enrolled in the major (typically junior and senior years). Students should select either the Basic Life Support for Health Providers course offered by the American Heart Association or the CPR/AED for Professional Rescuers and Healthcare Providers course offered by the American Red Cross.
   </p>
   <p>
    In order to be qualified to provide direct patient services, students must undergo an annual criminal background study conducted by the Minnesota Department of Human Services (MDHS). If a student is disqualified by the MDHS, he or she will be unable to provide direct patient care and he or she will be dismissed from the nursing program.
   </p>
   <p>
    Students beginning the nursing program must also be a certified nursing assistant (CNA). Students will need to provide documentation of Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) Nursing Assistant registration after successful completion of a Certified Nursing Assistant/Nursing Assistant Registered program prior to beginning the nursing program. Students must meet all college requirements for graduation, as well as complete eight prerequisite courses.
