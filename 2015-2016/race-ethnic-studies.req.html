  Majors are encouraged to include off-campus study in their programs. Students may wish to link a race and ethnic studies major with a major in one of the departments represented in the program. Race and ethnic studies majors are required to complete a senior project and give an oral presentation of their findings before the race and ethnic studies faculty in early May of their senior year.
