###  Social Studies Major with 5-12 Teaching Licensure

Students must take all twelve courses required for the major described above
plus  HIST 198 American History to 1865  and a prescribed set of education
courses and experiences required for licensure. Students must meet with Robert
McClure, education faculty, to plan their program. Students are encouraged to
double major and/or take additional coursework in economics, history,
political science, psychology, and sociology.

The licensure program extends student development in disciplinary content and
in pedagogy, which meets or exceeds Minnesota Board of Teaching Rules
8710.4800: Standards for Teachers of Social Studies. In addition to courses
and student teaching, requirements include passing MTLE standardized tests and
observations and teaching in classroom settings, including one in a setting of
diversity. For complete information about the teaching license, see [
