####  Areas of Emphasis in the Environmental Studies Major

#####  Natural Science

The natural science area of emphasis seeks to give students a broad exposure to the range of problems encountered by scientists working in environmental fields and the investigative tools they use, while providing a solid foundation for further study in one of the contributing disciplines. Students planning careers in environmental science are strongly urged to consider an additional major in biology or chemistry.

##  Environmental Studies Concentration

###  Requirements for the Concentration

The environmental studies concentration draws upon the disciplinary strengths of a traditional major and a set of courses focused on the environment. Students may utilize environmental studies-related upper-level courses within their own discipline to complete requirements of the concentration if the courses have a significant component that addresses environmental concerns. Unless permission is granted by the chair, a course may not count for more than one requirement in the concentration. Successful completion of at least 6 courses with a grade of C or better is required.
