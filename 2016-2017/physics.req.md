Prospective physics majors should enroll in PHYS 130 Analytical Physics I in the fall semester of their first year, along with calculus or other math course recommended by placement in Mathematics. It is possible to complete the physics major with a sophomore year start in PHYS 130; interested students should consult with the department chair or other physics faculty member. Students with AP, IB, PSEO, or significant college-level experience in physics may seek advanced placement - to start in a course beyond PHYS 130 - by consulting with the department chair.

PHYS 130  |  Analytical Physics I  |  1.00  
---|---|---  
PHYS 131  |  Analytical Physics II  |  1.00  
PHYS 232  |  Analytical Physics III  |  1.00  
PHYS 244  & PHYS 245  |  Modern Physics and Modern Physics Laboratory (0.25)  |  1.25  
PHYS 374  |  Classical Mechanics  |  1.00  
PHYS 375  |  Maxwell's Equations  |  1.00  
PHYS 385  |  Advanced Physics Laboratory (0.25)  |  0.25  
PHYS 386  |  Advanced Physics Laboratory (0.25)  |  0.25  
One physics elective numbered above 120 (this is waived for students obtaining teacher certification.)  |  1.00  
One additional physics elective numbered between 300 and 393  |  1.00  
Total Credits  |  8.75  
  
In some cases it is possible to use the PHYS 124-PHYS 125 sequence to transfer into the major; see the chair.

Remember to check the prerequisites for all courses. Mathematics prerequisites may include calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and either partial differential equations or multivariable calculus.

##  Recommendations for Graduate Study

Students planning on graduate work in physics, engineering, materials science or related areas should choose appropriate electives in the major and consider additional coursework in mathematics, computer science, or other sciences, depending on the field of interest. Summer research experience is strongly recommended, especially for students entering Ph.D. programs. Students pursuing masters degrees in engineering are encouraged to complete internships in their areas of interest.

Specific recommendations for Physics programs: To prepare for graduate study in physics, students are advised to take Quantum Mechanics (  PHYS 376  ) and Statistical Physics (  PHYS 379  ) and to consider additional physics electives or math courses such as complex analysis, abstract algebra, probability, statistics, numerical analysis, and real analysis.

Specific recommendations for Materials Science programs: To prepare for graduate study in materials science, students are advised to take Quantum Mechanics (  PHYS 376  ). In addition, students should consider Materials Engineering and Nanoscience (PHYS 362) and/or Statistical Physics (  PHYS 379  ) and/or additional physics electives or math courses such as complex analysis, abstract algebra, probability, statistics, numerical analysis, and real analysis.
