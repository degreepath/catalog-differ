  
  
The Middle Eastern studies concentration requires a minimum of five courses. Courses must deal in a significant and disciplined manner with one or more aspects of Middle Eastern culture or (medieval or modern) history. At least one course must be taken on campus. Typically, one course taken on Global Semester counts toward the concentration. Many courses offered by relevant departments at the American University of Cairo and Bogazici University, among other semester abroad destinations, count toward the concentration.

Courses taken abroad should be certified by the director of the Middle Eastern studies concentration as fulfilling the appropriate course requirements.
