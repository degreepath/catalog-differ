The subfield designation of PSCI 299 Topics in Political Science, PSCI 298
Independent Study, PSCI 398 Independent Research, PSCI 399 Seminar, Interim
courses, or other courses not listed above depends on the content of the
course in a given semester; students should consult with a faculty member in
political science and with the department academic administrative assistant to
determine the appropriate subfield for one of these courses. All level III
courses are offered as seminars with two prerequisites: PSCI 220 and one other
course in the relevant subfield.

Students may designate a selected statistics course OR one additional semester
of a world language beyond the level of proficiency required for general
education (French, German, or Spanish numbered above 232 or Chinese, Greek,
Latin, Japanese, Norwegian, or Russian numbered above 231) as one of their
nine courses in the political science major. Additional study in statistics
and/or a world language is especially recommended for students considering
graduate study.

Political science majors are also encouraged to seek out opportunities for
experiential or applied study through internships, off-campus study, on-campus
courses with an experiential component, or independent projects under faculty
supervision. Up to two off-campus courses instructed by non-St. Olaf faculty
may be included in the major. An internship for academic credit may also count
toward the major, although internships cannot be used to satisfy subfield
requirements. Additional suggestions and guidelines for including off-campus
work and experiential study in the political science major are available in
the department; students are encouraged to consult with their advisor in
making their plans.
