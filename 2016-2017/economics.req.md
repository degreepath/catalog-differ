Core courses --  ECON 261  and  ECON 262  , and  ECON 263  , or  STAT 272
plus  ECON 385  \-- all require an introductory course and calculus (usually
ECON 121  and  MATH 120  ). Core courses cannot be taken S/U.  
  
---|---

ECON 385  may count as a level III economic analysis course when taken to
fulfill the core course requirement.  
  
Students studying off-campus through St. Olaf affiliated programs may count up
to two off-campus courses as level II economic analysis courses towards the
economics major requirements. These courses must be approved in advance by the
chair of the Economics Department. To count towards the economics major,
courses must (a) be in recognized fields in economics, (b) require at least
Principles of Economics (ECON 121)  (or its equivalent) as a prerequisite, and
(c) be taught in an economics program or by faculty from an economics program.
Students may not count both a St. Olaf economic analysis course and a course
taken off campus towards the major if the courses are substantially the same.

##  Areas of Emphasis

The Economics Department offers four optional Areas of Emphasis that students
may complete in addition to a major in economics. There are two economics
areas: (1) international economic analysis and policy and (2) public policy
economics, and two management areas: (3) management and (4) finance. Students
may be certified in no more than one economics and one management studies area
of emphasis. Grades of C or better must be earned in all courses counted
towards an area of emphasis.

Contracts for each area of emphasis must be negotiated individually with the
assigned area director before the end of the studentâ€™s junior year. Copies of
contracts can be found on the [ Economics Department web page
](http://wp.stolaf.edu/economics/forms/department-forms/) . Please contact the
Economics Department for names of the current area directors.

Courses counted toward an area of emphasis may not also be counted toward any
requirements for the economics major.

##  International Economic Analysis and Policy Emphasis

The purpose of the International Economic Analysis and Policy emphasis is to
provide a structured program of study beyond the major, so that students will
expand their understanding of the international economy, and be better
prepared for careers in the private and public sectors.

Course List  Code  |  Title  |  Credits

topics  |  1.00

##  Public Policy Emphasis

The purpose of the public policy emphasis is to provide a structured program
of study beyond the major to give motivated students the opportunity for in-
depth work in a particular economic field. Students pursuing this emphasis
develop the critical insights necessary to understand how government
initiatives work, or do not work, to accomplish social goals such as
environmental protection, economic development, poverty reduction, health care
access, public education, and care for the elderly and the disabled.
Completion of the emphasis not only promotes a lifetime of informed civic
engagement and active citizenship, but it also prepares students for careers
in the public sector, as well as for admission to graduate programs in public
policy, economics, and law.
