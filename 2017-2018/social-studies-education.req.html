   Social Studies Major with 5-12 Teaching Licensure
  </h3>
  <p>
   Students must take all twelve courses required for the major described above plus HIST 198 American History to 1865 and a prescribed set of education courses and experiences required for licensure. Students must meet with Robert McClure, education faculty, to plan their program. Students are encouraged to double major and/or take additional coursework in economics, history, political science, psychology, and sociology.
  </p>
  <p>
   The licensure program extends student development in disciplinary content and in pedagogy, which meets or exceeds Minnesota Board of Teaching Rules 8710.4800: Standards for Teachers of Social Studies. In addition to courses and student teaching, requirements include passing MTLE standardized tests and observations and teaching in classroom settings, including one in a setting of diversity. For complete information about the teaching license, see
