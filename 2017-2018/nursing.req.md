##  Admission and Progression

Students are encouraged to express an interest in the nursing major upon
application for admission to St. Olaf College. Enrollment in the program is
limited and admission is competitive; therefore, early consultation with the
department chair is recommended. Interested students are assigned nursing
faculty as academic advisors.

##  Information for Students Applying for Direct Admission to the Nursing
Program

Students intending to major in nursing at the time of application to the

competitive, and conditional. Students seeking direct admission to the nursing
program must [ complete an additional application

nursing application includes two additional essays and an interview. More
information regarding the Direct Admission process can be [ found here

essay or interview.

##  Information for All Students Applying to the Nursing Program

The nursing major begins in the spring semester of the sophomore year.
Conditional acceptance into the nursing major will become final if students
meet the following criteria at the end of the sophomore year:

  1. Minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.85. 
  2. Prerequisites must be taken for a letter grade, cumulative grade point average 2.70. 
  3. Only one prerequisite course may be below C- and this course (or an alternate course approved by the Nursing Department chair) may be repeated once. 
  4. A minimum grade of C- must be achieved in the repeated or substituted course. 
  5. If a grade of C- is not achieved in the repeated or substituted course, the student may not continue in the major. 
  6. If two or more prerequisite courses are below C-, the student may not continue in the major. 
  7. Four prerequisite courses must be completed by the end of the fall semester of the sophomore year. 

Students not accepted may choose to be placed on a waiting list and will be
notified of their rank on that list. If openings occur, admission will be
offered to waiting list students by rank, highest rank first. Students not
accepted may appeal the admission decision to the Dean of the College. The
Academic Dean will ask for a written statement from both the student and the
department prior to rendering a decision. The Dean's decision will be final.

Students on the waiting list may reapply for admission to the nursing program
the following year. They will be considered in the next pool of applicants but
will not be guaranteed admission because they apply a second time.

In addition to the college health requirements, nursing students must also
provide documentation of: physical examination, immunization to Hepatitis B,
measles, mumps, varicella, rubella, influenza, and negative two-step
Tuberculosis Skin Test (TST)/Mantoux _or_ negative Blood Assay for
Mycobacterium (BAMT)/TB serum test _or_ negative chest x-ray (only with a
positive TST) after June 1 of both the junior and senior years in the major.

major (typically junior and senior years). Students should select either the
Basic Life Support for Health Providers course offered by the American Heart
Association or the CPR/AED for Professional Rescuers and Healthcare Providers
course offered by the American Red Cross.

In order to be qualified to provide direct patient services, students must
undergo an annual criminal background study conducted by the Minnesota
Department of Human Services (MDHS). If a student is disqualified by the MDHS,
he or she will be unable to provide direct patient care and he or she will be
dismissed from the nursing program.

assistant (CNA). Students will need to provide documentation of Minnesota
Department of Health (MDH) Nursing Assistant registration after successful
