Students arrange a major in mathematics by developing an Individualized
Mathematics Proposal (IMaP). An IMaP outlines a complete, coherent program of
study consistent with the goals of the individual student. The courses
included in a studentâ€™s IMaP are determined after consultation with an MSCS
faculty member and approved by the department chair.

A path through the major as described by a student's IMaP normally includes:

Calculus (two semesters)  |  2.00  
---|---  
Linear algebra (one semester)  |  1.00  
At least seven intermediate or advanced mathematics courses:  |  
Select two of the following transition courses:  |  2.00  
  
MATH 242

|  Modern Computational Mathematics  |  
  
MATH 244

|  Real Analysis I  |  
  
MATH 252

|  Abstract Algebra I  |  
Select an intermediate course from at least three of the following different
mathematical perspectives:  |  3.00  
  
Computation/modeling

|  
  
Continuous/analytic

|  
  
Discrete/combinatorial

|  
  
Axiomatic/algebraic

|  
Select at least two level III courses, at least one of which must be part of a
designated level II-level III sequence  |  2.00  
Total Credits  |  10  
  
An IMaP may include up to two related courses from statistics or computer
science; a current listing of such courses is available on the [ mathematics
web page ](http://wp.stolaf.edu/math/) . A student may also find a course
outside of MSCS that contributes significantly to a mathematical path of study
and may petition to have the course included in his or her IMaP.

The [ mathematics web page ](http://wp.stolaf.edu/math/) offers lists of
courses that satisfy each perspective, lists of sequences, and other useful
information. Students are encouraged to consult early with a mathematics
faculty member about planning an appropriate IMaP.

##  Recommendations for Mathematics Teaching Licensure

Mathematics majors who intend to teach grades 5-12 mathematics must meet all
of the normal requirements for the major while including specific courses
required for State of Minnesota licensure. Their IMaPs must include:

Basic requirements for all majors  |  
---|---  
MATH 232  |  Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning  |  1.00  
MATH 244  |  Real Analysis I  |  1.00  
MATH 252  |  Abstract Algebra I  |  1.00  
MATH 262  |  Probability Theory  |  1.00  
MATH 356  |  Geometry  |  1.00  
Course in statistics  |  1.00  
EDUC 350  |  Teaching of Mathematics, 5-12  |  1.00  
Several Education courses  1  |  
1  |

As listed in the [ Education ](http://wp.stolaf.edu/education/) description

Students should consult the mathematics licensure advisor for advice on
planning mathematics and education course sequences.
