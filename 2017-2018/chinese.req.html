     If a student has previous background in Chinese language and is initially placed (after the Chinese placement test and interview) in upper-division classes above CHIN 231 Intermediate Chinese I (e.g., CHIN 232 Intermediate Chinese II or CHIN 301 Third-Year Chinese I), the student will fulfill the total 9 credits requirement by taking additional upper-level language courses (above CHIN 302) and/or courses in English that focus on China/Chinese language and culture).

     The following courses currently fulfill this requirement: CHIN 320 Special Topics in Chinese, CHIN 351 Chinese Language and Society through the Media, CHIN 360 Professional Chinese, or the equivalent of a CHIN 320 or above course taken during Term in China at ECNU and/or other approved study abroad language programs.

     At least one course must examine transnationalism/regionalism/global perspectives or compare China/Chinese with other countries/cultures through specific disciplines (e.g. art, religion, literature, history, philosophy, ecnomics, and political science).  At least one of these four courses must be 300-level, and no more than one at 100-level.  One of these courses can be an Independent Study (capstone project) or the Asian Studies senior seminars (ASIAN 397 and ASIAN 399).  The Asian Conversation sequence (ASIAN 210, ASIAN 215 or ASIAN 216, ASIAN 220) will count for no more than two courses.
