AMST 100  |  American Culture: Interdisciplinary Perspectives  |  1.00  
---|---|---  
One level II American Studies topics course  |  1.00  
One level III American Studies seminar (the topics course and the seminar may be taken more than once, and if so, your number of disciplinary courses, see below, will be reduced accordingly)  |  1.00  
Six designated disciplinary courses (with at least one course in each of three departments)  |  6.00  
Total Credits  |  9  
  
Of the nine courses, at least two must carry MCD general education credit and at least two must be at level III.
