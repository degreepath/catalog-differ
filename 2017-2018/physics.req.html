  Prospective physics majors should enroll in PHYS 130 Analytical Physics I in the fall semester of their first year, along with calculus or other math course recommended by placement in Mathematics. It is possible to complete the physics major with a sophomore year start in PHYS 130; interested students should consult with the department chair or other physics faculty member. Students with AP, IB, PSEO, or significant college-level experience in physics may seek advanced placement - to start in a course beyond PHYS 130 - by consulting with the department chair.

  Recommendations for Graduate Study
 </h2>
 <p>
  Students planning on graduate work in physics, engineering, materials science or related areas should choose appropriate electives in the major and consider additional coursework in mathematics, computer science, or other sciences, depending on the field of interest. Summer research experience is strongly recommended, especially for students entering Ph.D. programs. Students pursuing masters degrees in engineering are encouraged to complete internships in their areas of interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Specific recommendations by field of study:
 </p>
 <p>
  Physics: To prepare for graduate study in physics, students are advised to take Quantum Mechanics (PHYS 376) and Statistical Physics (PHYS 379) and to consider additional physics electives or math courses such as complex analysis, abstract algebra, probability, statistics, numerical analysis, and real analysis. For example, Electronics (PHYS 246) develops skills that are useful in many experimental research settings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Materials Science: To prepare for graduate study in materials science, students are advised to take Quantum Mechanics (PHYS 376). In addition, students should consider Materials Engineering and Nanoscience (PHYS 362) and/or Statistical Physics (PHYS 379) and/or additional physics electives or math courses such as complex analysis, abstract algebra, probability, statistics, numerical analysis, and real analysis. For example, Electronics (PHYS 246) develops skills that are useful in many experimental research settings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Civil Engineering: To prepare for graduate study in civil engineering, students are advised to consider Engineering Design Practicum (PHYS 360), Materials Engineering and Nanoscience (PHYS 362), Electronics (PHYS 246) and/or other physics electives, along with appropriate courses in chemistry, mathematics, and computer science.
 </p>
 <p>
  Electrical Engineering: To prepare for graduate study in electrical engineering, students are advised to take Quantum Mechanics (PHYS 376) and Electronics (PHYS 246) and are strongly encouraged to take Statistical Physics (PHYS 379). Students should also consider Engineering Design Practicum (PHYS 360), Materials Engineering and Nanoscience (PHYS 362), and/or other physics electives, along with appropriate courses in chemistry, mathematics, and computer science.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mechanical Engineering: To prepare for graduate study in mechanical engineering, students are advised to consider Engineering Design Practicum (PHYS 360), Materials Engineering and Nanoscience (PHYS 362), Electronics (PHYS 246) and/or other physics electives, along with appropriate courses in chemistry, mathematics, and computer science. Quantum Mechanics (PHYS 376) is strongly encouraged for students interested in nanoscale technology and engineering.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other engineering fields: There are many fields within engineering, both within and outside the broad areas of civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering. These include acoustical engineering, aerospace engineering, biomedical engineering, and geotechnical engineering, to name a few. Engineering graduate programs are typically looking for solid preparation in areas such as physics, chemistry, mathematics, and computer programming. Some fields, such as biomedical engineering, require background in biology or other areas as well. Consult with the Engineering Advisor and specific graduate programs for further information.
