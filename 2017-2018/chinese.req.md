If a student has previous background in Chinese language and is initially
placed (after the Chinese placement test and interview) in upper-division
classes above CHIN 231 Intermediate Chinese I (e.g., CHIN 232 Intermediate
Chinese II or CHIN 301 Third-Year Chinese I), the student will fulfill the
total 9 credits requirement by taking additional upper-level language courses
(above CHIN 302) and/or courses in English that focus on China/Chinese
language and culture).

The following courses currently fulfill this requirement: CHIN 320 Special
Topics in Chinese, CHIN 351 Chinese Language and Society through the Media,
CHIN 360 Professional Chinese, or the equivalent of a CHIN 320 or above course
taken during _Term in China_ at ECNU and/or other approved study abroad
language programs.

At least one course must examine transnationalism/regionalism/global
perspectives or compare China/Chinese with other countries/cultures through
specific disciplines (e.g. art, religion, literature, history, philosophy,
ecnomics, and political science). At least one of these four courses must be
300-level, and no more than one at 100-level. One of these courses can be an
Independent Study (capstone project) or the Asian Studies senior seminars
(ASIAN 397 and ASIAN 399). The Asian Conversation sequence (ASIAN 210, ASIAN
215 or ASIAN 216, ASIAN 220) will count for no more than two courses.
