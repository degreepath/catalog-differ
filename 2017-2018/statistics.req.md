MATH 282 and MATH 384 may count toward the concentration when a relevant topic is being taught and the student obtains the permission of the program director.  
  
####  Experiential Learning Component (Optional)

Each concentrator is encouraged to participate in experientially based research or employment that takes statistical methods beyond the traditional classroom. This can occur on- or off-campus. Prior approval by the director of statistics program and a letter after the fact from a supervisor are required to earn credit. Excellent opportunities for experiential learning in statistics are available through academic internships (STAT 294), the mathematics practicum (MATH 390), and the Center for Interdisciplinary Research (CIR) (MSCS 389). As a CIR fellow, students can work during the academic year or summer with faculty on research from a variety of disciplines.

Note: For students considering graduate school in statistics or a closely related field, the following courses are recommended:

MATH 126  |  Calculus II  |  1.00  
---|---|---  
or MATH 128  |  Honors Calculus II  
MATH 220  |  Elementary Linear Algebra  |  1.00  
MATH 226  |  Multivariable Calculus  |  1.00  
MATH 230  |  Differential Equations I  |  1.00  
MATH 242  |  Modern Computational Mathematics  |  1.00  
MATH 244 & MATH 344  |  Real Analysis I and Real Analysis II  |  2.00  
CSCI 251 & CSCI 252  |  Software Design and Implementation and Software Design and Implementation Lab (0.25)  |  1.25  
  
STAT 110, STAT 212, and ECON 263 all provide an introduction to statistics, and students should not take more than one; they can all serve as a prerequisite for further courses, although ECON 263 is geared toward majors in economics. STAT 214 is also an introductory course that assumes no background in statistics, but it can also be taken by students coming from STAT 110, ECON 263 or AP Statistics who would like a transition into the statistics concentration.
