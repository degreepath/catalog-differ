<p><span class="programdescription">History explores the many facets of the human condition from the past to the present. History invites those who study it to develop an appreciation for the variety of human experiences. Demonstrating how the past shapes the present, the study of history also encourages an understanding of different world cultures, societies, and outlooks on their own terms. Students learn to analyze and to think critically about a broad range of issues and experiences. They also learn how to develop reasoned arguments and explanations from historical evidence. </span></p>
<p class="programdescription">Among St. Olaf departments, the History Department is distinctive in the variety of courses it offers for the college’s interdisciplinary programs. These courses are described here, and they are also listed in such program descriptions as Asian studies, environmental studies, and women’s and gender studies. In addition, history courses fulfill several different general education requirements, according to subject matter. The department is a major provider of HWC, MCG, MCD, and WRI courses. Some history courses count toward ALS-L, HBS, and ORC.</p>
<p class="programdescription">The habits of critical inquiry and the deep appreciation for the varieties of human experience across time and space that are developed in studying history provide the basis for a wide range of professional and personal vocations.  History majors are prepared for graduate and professional programs in history, law, museum studies, public health, and various cultural or area studies, and for developing careers in such diverse fields as education, business, ministry, government, and journalism.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2 class="goldhead" headerid="1" name="text">Overview of the Major</h2>
<p><span class="body">St. Olaf’s history offerings are structured to help students achieve different learning goals at different levels. In level I seminars, students approach history as a way of learning, through the critical reading of primary sources on specific historical topics. In level I foundational surveys, they explore the broad historical development of the world’s major societies and cultures. In level II surveys, students examine more specialized national, area, and topical developments. In level II major seminars, students develop their skills of analysis, interpretation, argumentation, and expression. Finally, level III seminars challenge students to recognize historical problems and to formulate their own questions about major historical issues, and engage ongoing debates among historians. </span></p>
<p class="body">History courses at level I do not have prerequisites. Level I seminars are open only to first-year students; level I foundational surveys are open to all students. History courses at level II generally do not have prerequisites either, since many of them count for general education credit. The major seminars at level II are especially designed for history majors, although other students may enroll as space permits. Level III courses generally require significant prior preparation; students with little or no background in the relevant area or period should consult with the instructor before registration.</p>

<h2 class="goldhead" headerid="3" name="text">Distinction</h2>
<p>See <a href="/academic-regulations-procedures/academic-honors/#distinction">Academic Honors</a></p>
<p class="body">Senior majors who have demonstrated high achievement in their coursework in History may apply for departmental distinction. Candidates must satisfy minimum grade point average requirements (3.50 overall, 3.70 in the major), and submit a portfolio of their work (normally consisting of two papers completed in History courses and an additional distinction essay) for faculty review. Students meeting grade point average requirements will be contacted by the department chair the first week of spring semester of their senior year, and will be invited to submit a portfolio. The formal review begins in April. Note: current seniors of the class of 2019 may opt to apply for distinction using the old method. Please see the <a href="https://wp.stolaf.edu/history/">History Department website</a> for details, forms, and timeline. </p>

<p><span class="body">The History Department supports several other programs: </span></p>
<ol>
	<li class="body">The social studies education major (see <a href="/academic-programs/social-studies-education/">Social Studies Education</a>) is appropriate for those considering a career in teaching history. Students in this major are able to double-major in history with careful planning. Interested students should consult with a faculty advisor in the Education Department.</li>
	<li class="body">The <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/flac/" target="_blank">Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum (FLAC)</a> program offers students opportunities to integrate their foreign-language skills with the study of history. Students in specially designated history classes can use their Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, German, Russian, or Chinese so that nothing is lost to them in translation!</li>
	<li class="body">History courses taken on St. Olaf off-campus programs can often be counted toward the major. Students who wish to count off-campus courses toward the major should seek approval from the department chair before beginning their programs. Some restrictions apply.</li>
	<li class="body">Historical internships with academic content may also be accepted for major credit.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="goldhead" headerid="5" name="text">Recommendations for Graduate Study</h2>
<p class="body">Students planning on graduate study in history should take advantage of the flexibility of the history major to develop depth of knowledge in a particular field, topic, or approach in order to position themselves for more focused advanced study.   Students might also consider developing a research project beyond the requirements of a level III seminar by completing <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HIST%20394" title="HIST 394" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HIST 394');">HIST 394</a> Academic Internship</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HIST%20397" title="HIST 397" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HIST 397');">HIST 397</a> History Research Workshop</span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HIST%20398" title="HIST 398" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HIST 398');">HIST 398</a> Independent Research</span>, participating in the Undergraduate Research Program, or completing the Distinction process.   Most graduate programs in history (including American and British history) require reading and/or speaking proficiency in one or two relevant languages beyond English.   Participation in the optional FLAC sections attached to a number of history courses (see above) is an excellent way to demonstrate both language proficiency and the capacity to apply that proficiency to the analysis of historical evidence.   Study abroad can also enhance preparation for graduate school.  In recent years, history majors have been accepted for advanced historical study at Duke University, William and Mary, Yale University, and the Universities of Chicago, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Toronto, and Virginia.</p>
