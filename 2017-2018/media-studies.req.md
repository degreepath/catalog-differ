With the approval of the program director, students assemble individualized programs of study involving a total of five courses. A concentration consists of a common introductory course, MEDIA 160, plus three approved courses drawn from departments and programs across the curriculum, an academic internship in a media-related field, and a digital portfolio. The purpose of the digital portfolio is to compile a variety of materials related to a media studies education in an integrative and useful way. The portfolio has proven valuable for students applying for jobs and other professional opportunities.

Requirements and plans for individual portfolios are discussed at a mandatory meeting for all junior and senior media studies concentrators, in the fall semester. Graduating concentrators submit their completed portfolios to the program director by April 15 of their senior year.

##  Media Internship

Students pursuing the media studies concentration enroll in and complete a credit-bearing, academic internship in a media-related field, e.g., film, television, video, radio, Internet, newspaper, magazine, book publishing, journalism, public relations, marketing, advertising, or graphic design. The internship may be undertaken at any time during a program of study. To secure academic credit for a summer internship, students must register for summer session II by June 1. Students are responsible for securing the internship placement and for consulting with the program director and director of academic internships in the  Piper Center for Vocation and Career  for additional information and guidance.
