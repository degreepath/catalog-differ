    The mathematical biology concentration consists of five courses, an integrative project, and participation in a Math Biology Symposium. A student may petition to count a course other than the pre-approved electives towards his or her concentration if the student can show and the director concurs that the course includes an integrative component related to mathematical and/or computational biology.

   Integrative Project
  </h2>
  <p>
   The project must be approved by the director in order for the student to finish the concentration. There are many ways in which the project can be completed.  For example, the level III biology electives in the concentration all include final projects that allow a student to work on an integrative project for the concentration. Other experiences that could fulfill this requirement include a research project such as a summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU); a project in the expanded Center for Interdisciplinary Research (eCIR); working with faculty to develop a module for a course; an independent research or independent study with a faculty member; or working with a faculty member to develop a computational lab that could be incorporated into an existing course.
  </p>
  <h2 headerid="5" name="requirementstext">
   Senior Math Biology Symposium
  </h2>
  <p>
   The symposium is open to the public and provides students the opportunity to explain mathematical and biological concepts to a broad audience. In addition, the symposium is an event that brings together all the students in the concentration, thus strengthening the mathematical biology community here at St. Olaf.
