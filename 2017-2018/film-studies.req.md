One elective course that focuses on practical aspects of film creation or
criticism. These courses emphasize modern film as professional practice,
asking students to master at least one of the main creative or technical skill
sets used in film-making (see list below).  |  1.00  
Integrative film studies  |  
One more elective drawn from the above categories, or an integrative film
topics course approved by the program (see list below), or a contract course
worked out in consultation with the program director and the instructor. This
course challenges students to synthesize their previous study of film in ways
consistent with their own needs and interests, emphasizing the
interdisciplinary nature of film studies. Students must present to the program
director a brief explanation of how their work in this course synthesizes
previous interests.  |  1.00
