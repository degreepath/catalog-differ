on women and gender. A concentration in women’s and gender studies consists
of:

---|---|---  
WMGST 121  |  Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies  |  1.00

In consultation with the instructor and the program director, concentrators
may count one course not designated as an approved women’s and gender studies
course. Students who apply partial-credit courses toward the concentration
must still complete the minimum number of required credits. No more than one
course taken elsewhere may be counted toward the concentration.
