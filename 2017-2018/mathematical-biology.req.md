The mathematical biology concentration consists of five courses, an
integrative project, and participation in a Math Biology Symposium. A student
may petition to count a course other than the pre-approved electives towards
his or her concentration if the student can show and the director concurs that
the course includes an integrative component related to mathematical and/or
computational biology.

Integrative Project  |  
Students are required to work on an independent project that integrates
mathematics, computer science, and/or statistics with biology.  |  
Senior Math Biology Symposium  |  
Seniors present their independent project in the form of a poster in a
Mathematical Biology Symposium held at St. Olaf in the spring.  |

##  Integrative Project

The project must be approved by the director in order for the student to
finish the concentration. There are many ways in which the project can be
completed. For example, the level III biology electives in the concentration
all include final projects that allow a student to work on an integrative
project for the concentration. Other experiences that could fulfill this
requirement include a research project such as a summer Research Experience
for Undergraduates (REU); a project in the expanded Center for
Interdisciplinary Research (eCIR); working with faculty to develop a module
for a course; an independent research or independent study with a faculty
member; or working with a faculty member to develop a computational lab that
could be incorporated into an existing course.

##  Senior Math Biology Symposium

The symposium is open to the public and provides students the opportunity to
explain mathematical and biological concepts to a broad audience. In addition,
the symposium is an event that brings together all the students in the
concentration, thus strengthening the mathematical biology community here at
St. Olaf.
